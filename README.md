# fira-code-emacs

Some code to make Fira Code 2.0 work in Emacs.

To install, first run `make`.  Copy some or all of the files in `modified` to
you `~/.fonts` directory.  Modify `fira-code.el` if desired, load it into Emacs,
and ensure `fira-code-mode` is enabled for any buffers where you want
ligatures.  Set your default font to one of the Fira Emacs variants.  If you want
to see all the ligatures and test that they are displayed correctly, open
demo.txt into Emacs.
